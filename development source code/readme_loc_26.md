# Introduction

[Level of Confidence](https://www.lozano-hemmer.com/level_of_confidence.php), 2015

Version v26

works on macOS 10.8 or newer. 
This most recent version has been tested and compiled with openFrameworks v0.11.2 and of_v20230326_osx_release and can be compiled to work both on Intel and ARM (M1, M2) Apple computers.

# Installation

Download the software from GitHub, unzip the folder and place it on the desktop or anywhere you want.

- Because of a security method introduced by Apple, you will need to do the following, otherwise the app will crash at startup. Once you have unzipped the downloaded folder, open it, find the LOC_26.app and move it elsewhere outside of such folder (the desktop is ok) and then move it back to where it was.

Open "System Preferences"

- on newer macOS you also will have to go to "Security & Privacy" and in the "General" tab allow the LOC.app to open.
- go to "Desktop & Screen Saver" and set Screen Saver to "Start after" never.
- go to "Energy Saver" and unselect "Put hard disks to sleep ..."
- got to "Displays"  and set "Rotation" to 90Ëš 
- while still in "Display" check that the resolution is set to 1920x1080
- If you use a laptop with OSX 10.9 or higher go to "Mission Control" and unselect "Automatically rearrange ... " and "Displays have separate Spaces", otherwise the software will not run on your external Display
